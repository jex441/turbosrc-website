        <h3>What is VotePower?</h3>
        <p>
           One VotePower is equal to 1 vote which is used to vote on pull requests for a repository. You can either vote to merge the pull request or vote to close the pull request.
           So if you have 100, 000 VotePower, casting your vote is equivalent to 100, 000 votes in favor of either merging or closing the pull request.
        </p>
        <p>
           The default supply of VotePower for a repository put on Turbosrc is 1 million.
        </p>
        <h3>How does one get on Turbosrc?</h3>
        <p>
          Download the Turbosrc web extension<a href="https://github.com/turbo-src/chrome-extension" target="_blank"> here </a>and sign up. Then go the Github page of your project and open the Turbosrc web extension. 
          You will be prompted to log in and given the option to add your project to Turbosrc or interact with projects already on Turbosrc.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you own VotePower on a project simply navigate to its pull request page on Github. There you will see vote status buttons for each pull request
          which allow you to monitor current and past voting activity as well as vote on each pull request.
        </p>
        <h3>Does VotePower on one project work on another?</h3>
        <p>
          No. VotePower is specific to each project. You could have 100 VotePower on Alice's project or
          200, 000 VotePower on Bob's project, and none at all on a different project.
        </p>
        <h3>How do you get VotePower?</h3>
        <p>
          Be a part of the community in the project you want VotePower. Maintainers are encouraged to distribute VotePower to their
          contributors based on their involvement and quality of their contributions as well as to their sponsors who rely heavily on the project.

        <h3>What is the benefit of having VotePower in a project I do not maintain?</h3>
        <p>
          The benefit of having VotePower in a project you don't maintain is that you have a say in whether or not pull requests 
          get merged or closed. The more VotePower you have, the more votes you have at your disposal. VotePower is distributed 
          by the project maintainers to contributors based on merit or to sponsors. This means that you can earn VotePower by 
          contributing to the project and be recognized for your contributions.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the best way to get VotePower in a project I do not maintain?</h3>
        <p>
          To get VotePower in a project, you will need to join the community of that project and contribute to it. 
          Project maintainers have the ability to distribute VotePower to their contributors based on merit or to their sponsors. 
          Once you have been awarded VotePower, you can use it to vote on pull requests on the project's Github page. Remember that 
          you cannot use VotePower from one project on another as they are created independently by each project's maintainer.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Can VotePower that I own be taken away from me?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Nope. All transfers of VotePower are final. Once it is yours you may do with it as you please, either by actively voting on
          pull requests or transferring it to other contributors or interested parties.
        </p>

        <h3>What’s the difference between a maintainer and contributor on Turbosrc?</h3>
        <p>
            Being a maintainer means that you are the first to add an existing project to Turbosrc. Once adding your project to Turbosrc you will be 
            credited with the entirety of the VotePower. You can then keep or distribute as little or as much as you would like.
            There are no rules for how much VotePower you give out. And you can distribute varying amounts of VotePower to contributors.
        </p>
            <p>
            Currently, you must have a project on Github to add to Turbosrc. However, Turbosrc is built to be cross-platform and it will work
            across various code hosting services.
            Once you allocate VotePower, you can’t re-allocate or take it back. Users are free to transfer VotePower from there if they wish.
            However, If a user violates the network’s terms of service and are removed from the network, their VotePower is distributed pro-rata
            among your existing contributors, including yourself.
        </p>
        <h3>Why should I put my project on Turbosrc?</h3>
        <p>
          The benefit of putting your project on Turbosrc is that it allows for the allocation and distribution of VotePower among contributors. 
          VotePower enables contributors to vote on pull requests, with a majority vote required to merge or close a request. This system ensures 
          that code cannot be added or removed from a project without proper community involvement. Additionally, Turbosrc allows for easy monitoring 
          of ongoing activities and provides a platform for open-source sharing and collaboration. Ultimately, adding your project to Turbosrc can help 
          to foster a stronger community and enhance the quality of your project.
        </p>
        <h3>Are forks of project’s allowed on Turbosrc? Can I get a project removed that forked mine?</h3>
        <p> 
            Any project that has an open source license can be on Turbosrc. And no, you can not remove a forked project, just like you can not remove a 
            fork on Github. Forks are encouraged as open source is about
            sharing code. However, the value of a project is based on the usefulness of the code and the community and network effects
            so generally only a small subset of forks become more popular than the original.

        <h3>What is VotePower?</h3>
        <p>One VotePower gives you a 1 vote on pull request - yes to merges or no to close. You can have more than 1 VotePower (e.g. 100,000
            VotePower). The supply of VotePowers is 1 million per project. So if you have 100,000 VotePower you have 100,000 votes.</p>
        <h3>How does one get on Turbosrc?</h3>
        <p>Download the Turbosrc web extension here and sign up.
            If you own VotePower on a project, simply navigate to its pull request page on Github. You’ll see features load up that will allow you
            to vote and monitor what’s going on.
            If you want to add you project to Turbosrc, go the Github page of your project and open the Extension. The Extension will give you
            the option to add it to Turbosrc. It ask you to sign into you Github account and authenticate.</p>
        <h3>Does VotePower on one project work on another?</h3>
        <p>No. VotePower supply is created by the initial maintainer on each project separately. You could have 1 VotePower on Project A or
            500,000 VotePower on Project B, or none at all on Project C and so forth.</p>
        <h3>How do you get VotePower?</h3>
        <p>Be a part of the community in the project you want VotePower. Maintainers are encouraged to distribute VotePower to their
            contributors meritocratically or to their sponsors.</p>

        <h3>What is VotePower?</h3>
        <p>One VotePower gives you 1 vote on a pull request on a Turbosrc project.
            Vote “ yes” to merges or “no” to close. You can have more than 1 VotePower (e.g. 100,000 VotePower). The supply of VotePowers is 1
            million per project.
            No code can be added or deleted in a project outside of a pull request that is merged or closed with VotePower. It takes a majority
            vote to merge or close a pull request. So if you have 100,000 VotePower in Project A, you have 100,000 votes, which is 10%.
            Some, such as maintainers or core contributors of a Turbosrc project, may own a lot more than others. Or not. Depends on how the
            initial maintainer distributes VotePower amongst its contributors and what they feel works best for the project and community.</p>
        <h3>Does VotePower on one project work on another?</h3>
        <p>No. VotePower supply is created by the initial maintainer on each project separately. You could have 1 VotePower on Project A or
            500,000 VotePower on Project B, or none at all on Project C and so forth.</p>
        <h3>How do you get VotePower?</h3>
        <p>Be a part of the community in the project you want VotePower. Maintainers are encouraged to distribute VotePower to their
            contributors meritocratically or to their sponsors.</p>

        <h3>What’s the difference between a maintainer and contributor on Turbosrc?</h3>
        <p>A maintainer means you are the first to add an existing open source project on Turbosrc. You can allocate VotePower. You can keep or
            distribute as little or as much as you want. So you can choose to retain majority VotePower. There are no rules for how much
            VotePower you give out. And you can distribute varying amounts of VotePower to contributors.
            Currently, you must have a project on Github to add to Turbosrc. However, Turbosrc is built to be cross-platform and it will work
            across various code hosting services.
            Once you allocate VotePower, you can’t re-allocate or take it back. Users are free to transfer VotePower from there if they wish.
            However, If a user violates the network’s terms of service and are removed from the network, their VotePower is distributed pro-rata
            among your existing contributors, including yourself.</p>
        <h3>Are forks of project’s allowed on Turbosrc? Can I get a project removed that forked mine?</h3>
        <p>Any project that has an open source license can be on Turbosrc. For complete list of accepted open source licenses,, see here.
            And no, you can’t remove a forked project, just like you can’t remove a fork on Github. Forks are encouraged as open source is about
            sharing code.. However, the value of a project is based on the usefulness of the code and the community and network effects
            (metcalf) so generally only a small subset of forks become more popular than the original.</p>
        <h3>I have a license that’s not eligible, but I want to be on Turbosrc.</h3>
